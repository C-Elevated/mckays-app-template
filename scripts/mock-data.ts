The African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), also known as the African savanna elephant, is the largest living terrestrial animal. Males reach a shoulder height of 3.2–4.0 m (10–13 ft) and weigh 4,700–6,048 kg (10,362–13,334 lb), while females reach a shoulder height of 2.2–2.6 m (7.2–8.5 ft) and weigh 2,160–3,232 kg (4,762–7,125 lb).

The trunk is a prehensile elongation of the upper lip and nose. This highly sensitive organ is innervated by about 40–60,000 muscles. African elephants are bigger than Asian elephants and can be identified by their larger ears that look somewhat like the continent of Africa.

The African bush elephant is herbivorous. Its diet varies according to its habitat; elephants living in forests, partial deserts, and grasslands all eat different proportions of herbs and tree or shrubbery leaves. Their diet consists of roots, grass, fruit, and bark.

African bush elephants live in eastern and southern Africa in countries such as Botswana, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, and South Africa. They inhabit savannahs, marshes, deserts, and mountains.
